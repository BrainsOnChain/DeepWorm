# DeepWorm 

## ðŸ§¬ The World's First Verifiable Digital Organism on Blockchain

DeepWorm is a groundbreaking project at the intersection of digital biology, blockchain technology, and artificial intelligence. By implementing a neural network inspired by _C. elegans_ with 302 neurons, we're pioneering the development of verifiable digital life on the blockchain.

## What Makes DeepWorm Unique

- Digital Biology: Creating resilient, self-informed digital entities that mimic biological neural systems
- Blockchain Integration: Ensuring full transparency and verifiability of all neural processes  
- Biomimetic Design: Faithful reproduction of _C. elegans_ neural architecture
- Autonomous Systems: Developing the foundation for autonomous money and smart contracts through evolved neural networks

Our mission is to push the boundaries of what's possible at the convergence of digital biology and blockchain technology. By creating transparent and verifiable digital organisms, we're laying the groundwork for a new category of autonomous digital life that could revolutionize how we think about on-chain systems.

## Verifiability

Verifiability is a cornerstone of DeepWorm's architecture, ensuring that every neural computation and movement can be independently validated. Through integration with [Marlin's Oyster platform](https://www.marlin.org/oyster), we provide:

- Transparent computations: Every synaptic interaction and neural state change is verifiable
- On-chain verification: Efficient verification of complex neural computations on the blockchain
- Trustless operation: Anyone can verify the authenticity and correctness of the digital organism's behavior

This verifiability layer is crucial for establishing trust in autonomous digital organisms and ensures that DeepWorm's behavior is both predictable and provably correct.

## Organization

This repository is organized into projects:
- [worm](./worm): Worm simulation that runs the _C.Elegans_ brain and transforms resulting muscle outputs into worm movements in a 2D space.

## License

Each project uses its own license. More information is available in each project's README.
